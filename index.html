Imagine creating a world in which your child is immersed in music, listening to beautiful melodies throughout the day and enthusiastically imitating those sounds in a pleasant, cozy, daily practice. At Music Treehouse Piano Studio, students learn to play piano by listening, repetition, positive reinforcement...and most of all through a carefully cultivated environment characterized by a blend of encouragement, joy, and fun.

Music Treehouse Piano Studio is pleased to offer Suzuki piano lessons for interested families as well as traditional lessons. You may be wondering what the difference is between the two teaching styles.

<h3>suzuki or traditional piano lessons...what’s the difference?</h3>
With traditional lessons, the student attends lessons with the parent. The parent may or may not observe the lesson and may or may not assist with practice. The student will begin learning the pieces in the Suzuki books by rote and by ear and may spend some time listening to the Suzuki repertoire. The student will also begin learning to read music immediately. Parents are encouraged to participate in the learning process, but the primary relationship is between the student and the teacher. Traditional lessons are available for students eight years old and older. 

With Suzuki lessons, the student attends lessons with the parent. The parent participates fully in the lessons, taking notes and learning the first few pieces in Suzuki Book 1. The parent also takes on the role of the home teacher, reinforcing the lessons during home practice. The student will begin learning the Suzuki repertoire by rote and by ear and spend a lot of time listening to the pieces. The student may not begin reading music right away, but rather absorb the music through listening and repetition, much the same way children learn their native language. This is why the Suzuki Method is often called the Mother Tongue Method. The primary relationships are between the student and the teacher, the student and the parent, and the teacher and the parent. This is known as the Suzuki Triangle. Suzuki lessons are available for children as young as three years old.
  
Is one method better than the other? One method is not necessarily better than the other for students and families. However, the Suzuki philosophy of Every Child Can asserts that all children can learn to play music with a beautiful tone and a beautiful heart, not just those born with so-called innate talent. This is much easier to attain when parents are involved in learning. The Suzuki Method is also well-suited to teaching very young children.
  
As parents, only you can determine which method is best for your children and your families. It is important to decide on your level of involvement based upon many factors, including the age of your child. Once you set the expectation of the level of parent involvement, you set the stage for success.
