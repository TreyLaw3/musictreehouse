Imagine creating a world in which your child is immersed in music, listening to beautiful melodies throughout the day and enthusiastically imitating those sounds in a pleasant, cozy, daily practice. At Music Treehouse Piano Studio, students learn to play piano by listening, repetition, positive reinforcement...and most of all through a carefully cultivated environment characterized by a blend of encouragement, joy, and fun.

Music Treehouse Piano Studio is pleased to offer Suzuki piano lessons for interested families as well as traditional lessons. You may be wondering what the difference is between the two teaching styles.

<h3>Suzuki or Traditional Piano lessons...What’s the difference?</h3>
With traditional lessons, the student attends lessons with the parent. The parent may or may not observe the lesson and may or may not assist with practice. The student will begin learning the pieces in the Suzuki books by rote and by ear and may spend some time listening to the Suzuki repertoire. The student will also begin learning to read music immediately. Parents are encouraged to participate in the learning process, but the primary relationship is between the student and the teacher. Traditional lessons are available for students eight years old and older.
